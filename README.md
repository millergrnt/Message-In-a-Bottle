# Message-In-a-Bottle

Message in a Bottle is a C, command line based messaging system
Currently it is unthreaded and is a 1-1 messaging system where each message needs a reply before you can continue to message

Future wishes:
  A sending thread who will handle all of the user's input and send them so you can send multiple messages before getting replies
  A recieving thread who will handle all of the responses for the same goal
  
  Main server which will hold a database of all user's names and their DNS so you can chat with specific users
  
  Multiple messaging threads at once in different colors so you can differentiate the messages
